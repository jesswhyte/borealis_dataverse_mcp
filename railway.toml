# These will be set in Railway dashboard, but documenting here:
# PORT - Set automatically by Railway
# AUTH_TOKENS - Comma-separated list of valid bearer tokens
# MCP_TRANSPORT - Set to "http" for Railway (auto-detected, but can be explicit)

# Note: Railway will use TCP health checks by default
# FastMCP doesn't provide a /health endpoint, only /sse
